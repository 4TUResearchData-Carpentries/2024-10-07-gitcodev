# Version Control and Collaborative Development for Research Software
## TU Delft, 7-10 October 2024
Type-along logs for Version Control and Collaborative Development for Research Software

This respository contains the type-along logs for the class.
You will find the logs of every command the instructors type in the *Git* portion of the course
in the following files:

- **lesson1.txt** Commands from lesson 1: working with local git repositories
- **lesson2.txt** Commands from lesson 2: working with branches and remote repositories

Both of these files will be empty at the start of the class, and will fill up as the day progresses. They are useful if you find yourself needing to catch up at some poing, or want to review what was done after the course.
